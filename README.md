B+Tree implementation

This repository contains implementations of B-Tree and B+Tree in .c files.

The user should run these codes in his/her compiler.

Instructions for B-Tree-

In the main function : At first our
program asks user to enter the value of t(t is minimum degree of B-Tree). Then our program 
asks the user to enter A or B. If the user enters A our program first
inserts the numbers 100, 99, . . . , 1 in this sequence to the B-tree with minimum
degree t. Then our program traverses the B-tree and prints the values
using the B-TREE-INORDER-TRAVERSE function. Then it asks user to enter
a number k to search. Our program then searches k in the B-tree and return
the result accordingly.
In case the user enters B, our program givea the following options to
the user: I for insertion, S for search, M for finding minimum, T for traversing
the B-tree, E for exit. We assume that the elements inserted in the B-tree are
distinct.

Instructions for B+Tree-

In B+Tree a guide is printed for all the operations expected from the user. Default value of order of B+Tree is 4, minimum is 3 and maximum user can enter is 100.
